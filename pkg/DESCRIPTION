Description: This is a package implemented for flexible identity-by-descent (IBD) matrix estimation in F2 pedigrees. The IBD matrix estimate is approached by a Monte Carlo strategy, where the segregation of the founder alleles is easy to set up. Epistatic IBD matrices can also be calculated for two linked loci. Such IBD matrix estimates are typically used in variance component quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis. Parallelization using snowfall is implemented to accelerate the Monte Carlo sampling program.
