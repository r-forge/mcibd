Description: This is a package implemented for flexible identity-by-descent (IBD) matrix estimation in F2 pedigrees. The IBD matrix estimate is approached by a Monte Carlo strategy, where the segregation of founder alleles is easy to define. Epistatic IBD matrices can also be calculated for two arbitrary loci. Such IBD matrix estimates are typically used in variance component quantitative trait loci (QTL) analysis. Parallelization is implemented to enhance the performance of Monte Carlo sampling.
